In today&rsquo;s digital age, protecting your online identity and personal information has become more crucial than ever. Cyber threats are continually evolving, and one of the most effective ways to safeguard yourself against these risks is by practicing excellent password hygiene. Here&rsquo;s why it matters and what steps you can take to ensure your passwords are strong and secure.
Why Password Hygiene Matters
Every day, cybercriminals attempt to exploit weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to sensitive personal, financial, and professional information. According to Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, compromised passwords account for 81% of hacking-related breaches. Poor password practices can lead to identity theft, financial losses, and even damage to your reputation. Adopting robust password habits drastically reduces your vulnerability and helps ensure your digital safety.">
