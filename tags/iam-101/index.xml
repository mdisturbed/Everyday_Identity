<h1 id="iam-101-rbac-abac-and-pbac--choosing-the-right-access-model">IAM 101: RBAC, ABAC, and PBAC – Choosing the Right Access Model</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Access control models define <strong>who can access what</strong> within your systems—and more importantly, <strong>under what conditions</strong>. The most common models—<strong>RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</strong>, <strong>ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)</strong>, and <strong>PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control)</strong>—offer different strengths depending on your organization’s complexity, compliance needs, and operational maturity. In this post, we’ll explore each model, compare real-world use cases, and help you decide which approach fits your identity strategy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-background">🔍 Background</h2>
<p>In the IAM world, <strong>authorization</strong> is the engine that drives secure access—yet it&rsquo;s also where things get messy. I&rsquo;ve seen it firsthand during audits, mergers, app onboarding, and cloud migrations.</p>
<p>The first time I inherited a role matrix built on RBAC with 300+ overlapping roles? It was chaos. That was 2012. Since then, I’ve implemented cleaner, more scalable access control systems using ABAC and, in advanced cases, PBAC.</p>
<p>Choosing the right model isn&rsquo;t just a technical decision—it’s a governance one. It determines how granular, flexible, and enforceable your access policies will be across on-prem, cloud, SaaS, and hybrid environments.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-access-control-models-explained">🧱 Access Control Models Explained</h2>
<h3 id="-what-is-rbac">🔐 What is RBAC?</h3>
<p><strong>Role-Based Access Control</strong> assigns access based on job roles. Each role maps to a set of permissions, and users are assigned roles.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A user in the &ldquo;HR Manager&rdquo; role automatically gets access to Workday, Payroll, and Benefits Admin.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-pros">✅ Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand and manage</li>
<li>Works well in stable orgs with clear job structures</li>
<li>Widely supported in enterprise systems</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-cons">❌ Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explodes in complexity as exceptions grow</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t scale well across dynamic environments</li>
<li>Often leads to “role creep” (users get too many roles)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="-what-is-abac">🧠 What is ABAC?</h3>
<p><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control</strong> goes beyond roles by evaluating <strong>attributes</strong>—user department, location, device trust level, time of day, etc.</p>
<h4 id="example-1">Example:</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Allow access to the finance dashboard if user.department = &lsquo;Finance&rsquo; AND device.compliant = true AND location = &lsquo;US&rsquo;.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-pros-1">✅ Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Highly granular and dynamic</li>
<li>Ideal for modern, hybrid environments</li>
<li>Supports context-aware security</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-cons-1">❌ Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be hard to audit or visualize</li>
<li>Policy logic can become complex</li>
<li>Needs clean, consistent attribute data</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="-what-is-pbac">📜 What is PBAC?</h3>
<p><strong>Policy-Based Access Control</strong> (often seen as an evolution of ABAC) centers around central, codified policies written in natural or declarative language.</p>
<h4 id="example-2">Example:</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Managers can approve expense reports for direct reports under $5,000.”</li>
<li>“Deny access to sensitive data unless classification = &lsquo;Internal&rsquo; and user has completed training.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-pros-2">✅ Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expressive, business-aligned policies</li>
<li>Useful in governance-heavy industries (finance, healthcare)</li>
<li>Enables Just-in-Time and risk-based access models</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-cons-2">❌ Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires robust policy engine (like Axiomatics, PlainID)</li>
<li>Strong coordination between IAM and business units</li>
<li>Learning curve for authoring policies</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-real-world-use-cases">🏢 Real-World Use Cases</h2>
<h3 id="-healthcare-organization--rbac-first-then-abac">🧾 Healthcare Organization – RBAC First, Then ABAC</h3>
<p>A healthcare system I worked with started with classic RBAC (Doctors, Nurses, Admins) but added ABAC when telehealth rolled out. Now, patient records are only viewable if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user is assigned to the patient’s care team</li>
<li>Access is from a compliant device</li>
<li>The shift is currently active</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-government-agency--pbac-for-zero-trust">🏛️ Government Agency – PBAC for Zero Trust</h3>
<p>A federal agency uses PBAC to implement Zero Trust. Access is defined by central policies like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only users who have completed clearance check and are within U.S. jurisdiction may access classified documents.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Policies are enforced through integration with SIEM and UEBA tools that feed into dynamic risk scoring.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-cited-study">📊 Cited Study</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Gartner’s “Market Guide for Attribute-Based Access Control” (2022), <strong>by 2026, 60% of enterprises will phase out pure role-based models</strong> in favor of attribute and policy-based methods to handle complex, dynamic workforces and multi-cloud access needs.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="-implementation-tips-for-it-teams">🔧 Implementation Tips for IT Teams</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re evaluating your access control strategy, here&rsquo;s how I recommend approaching it:</p>
<h3 id="1-start-simple">1. <strong>Start Simple</strong></h3>
<p>Use RBAC to handle common, static job functions. Get your roles cleaned up and mapped properly.</p>
<h3 id="2-layer-in-abac-where-needed">2. <strong>Layer in ABAC Where Needed</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t rip and replace. Add ABAC where roles fall short—like context-aware access, contractor logic, or hybrid user states.</p>
<h3 id="3-build-toward-policy-governance">3. <strong>Build Toward Policy Governance</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a regulated industry or preparing for Zero Trust, start introducing PBAC policies aligned to business outcomes (e.g., data classification, training completion, risk score).</p>
<h3 id="4-leverage-your-idp-or-iga-platform">4. <strong>Leverage Your IdP or IGA Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Modern IAM platforms like Okta, Azure AD, SailPoint, or Saviynt often support hybrid RBAC/ABAC logic. Use these tools to enforce least privilege dynamically.</p>
<h3 id="5-dont-skip-auditing-and-review">5. <strong>Don’t Skip Auditing and Review</strong></h3>
<p>No matter the model, ensure access is reviewed quarterly and attested by business owners.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-final-thoughts">🧭 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all access model. But here&rsquo;s how I like to think of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong> is great for static environments with clear roles.</li>
<li><strong>ABAC</strong> is essential for dynamic, hybrid, and cloud-based work.</li>
<li><strong>PBAC</strong> is your go-to when business rules drive access—or when regulators require explainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best programs use a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>—starting with RBAC for structure, layering ABAC for flexibility, and adopting PBAC for risk-based governance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As identity professionals, our goal isn&rsquo;t just granting access—it&rsquo;s <strong>granting the <em>right</em> access, at the <em>right</em> time, for the <em>right</em> reason.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) governs the entire digital identity journey—from onboarding new employees to adjusting access when they change roles, to securely deactivating accounts when they leave. This &ldquo;Joiners, Movers, and Leavers&rdquo; process is critical to both security and operational efficiency. When mismanaged, it leads to overprovisioned users, dormant accounts, compliance failures, and insider threats. This article breaks down the core lifecycle stages, shows how automation can fix the chaos, and offers practical strategies drawn from real enterprise deployments.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-background">🔍 Background</h2>
<p>After 15 years in IAM, I&rsquo;ve learned this: the <strong>lifecycle is where most identity programs succeed—or completely fall apart</strong>.</p>
<p>You can have MFA, PAM, and Zero Trust. But if former employees still have access, or if contractors sit dormant in your HR system, your “secure perimeter” is full of holes.</p>
<p>The lifecycle process—commonly called <strong>JML (Joiners, Movers, Leavers)</strong>—is one of the most overlooked pillars in Identity and Access Management. It should be simple. In practice? It’s often a tangled web of manual tickets, disconnected systems, and tribal knowledge.</p>
<p>This post will help you fix that.</p>

<h2 id="-the-three-stages-of-lifecycle-management">👥 The Three Stages of Lifecycle Management</h2>
<h3 id="-1-joiners--onboarding-users-securely">🔹 1. <strong>Joiners – Onboarding Users Securely</strong></h3>
<p>Joiners are new hires, contractors, interns, or vendors who need accounts and access. This is your first chance to make a secure <em>and</em> smooth first impression.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger provisioning from your source of truth (HRIS like Workday, SAP, or BambooHR)</li>
<li>Automatically assign access based on role, department, location</li>
<li>Require MFA enrollment at first login</li>
<li>Limit access to least privilege from day one</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Example: A new marketing associate is hired. Their role triggers automatic creation of email, Slack, Adobe, and SharePoint access. MFA and training are enforced before access is granted.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-2-movers--managing-internal-changes">🔹 2. <strong>Movers – Managing Internal Changes</strong></h3>
<p>Movers are people who shift roles, departments, locations, or teams. Without a process, movers accumulate access—leading to &ldquo;permission bloat&rdquo; and audit nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use real-time attribute updates (title, department, manager) from HR</li>
<li>Automatically adjust group memberships, entitlements, and app access</li>
<li>Remove no-longer-needed access as part of each move</li>
<li>Trigger a re-certification or approval flow for sensitive access</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Example: A finance analyst moves to sales ops. Finance access is revoked, CRM access is granted, and access to reporting tools is adjusted automatically.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-3-leavers--offboarding-without-loose-ends">🔹 3. <strong>Leavers – Offboarding Without Loose Ends</strong></h3>
<p>Leavers include employees who resign, are terminated, or complete contracts. This is where poor lifecycle processes turn into real security risks.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Termination in HR triggers immediate deprovisioning</li>
<li>Disable SSO and privileged accounts within minutes</li>
<li>Archive email and files where applicable</li>
<li>Reclaim licenses, devices, and security tokens</li>
<li>Notify managers and stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Example: A contractor finishes their engagement. Their end date in HR disables all accounts within 15 minutes, notifies IT, and removes their access from Zoom, Jira, and AWS.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="-real-world-lessons-from-the-field">🏛️ Real-World Lessons from the Field</h2>
<p>I once consulted for a healthcare org where <strong>access removal took 3–5 days</strong> due to manual ServiceNow tickets. During that lag, former employees still had access to PHI. We implemented HR-triggered provisioning with SailPoint + Okta, reducing offboarding time to under 15 minutes—and passed their next HIPAA audit cleanly.</p>
<p>Another client used a shared spreadsheet for managing contractor access. You can guess what happened: hundreds of active accounts for people who hadn’t worked there in years.</p>
<p>Lifecycle failures aren’t hypothetical. They’re happening daily—and they’re avoidable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-cited-study">📚 Cited Study</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a 2023 <strong>Ponemon Institute</strong> report, organizations that automated identity lifecycle processes reduced insider threat-related incidents by <strong>45%</strong> and saw a 28% drop in audit violations tied to excessive access.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="-final-thoughts">🧭 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Lifecycle management isn’t flashy, but it’s foundational. It’s where automation, governance, and Zero Trust meet. When done well, JML enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tighter security</li>
<li>Better compliance</li>
<li>Happier employees and IT teams</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to start small—integrate HR, automate basic onboarding/offboarding, and grow into adaptive access and recertification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IAM isn’t just about protecting access—it’s about controlling it from <strong>beginning to end.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="-real-world-lessons-from-the-field">🏛️ Real-World Lessons from the Field</h2>
<p>During my time at a previous role, we kicked off our IAM journey the hard way—<strong>with Excel spreadsheets</strong>. Every new hire, role change, or termination required someone in IT or HR to manually update a shared document. It wasn’t just tedious—it was <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>Onboarding could take <strong>hours or even days</strong>, depending on when someone reviewed the sheet and how fast the manual tickets were processed. Sometimes users would start on day one without email or key app access. Others left the company, but their access lingered—sometimes for weeks—because no one flagged them for removal.</p>
<p>We had no centralized system, no automation, and no visibility. It was a perfect storm for audit failures, excessive access, and frustrated managers.</p>
<p>That experience was a turning point. We implemented a modern IAM platform integrated with Workday and Okta. Once we moved from Excel to policy-based automation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joiners had accounts ready before day one</li>
<li>Movers triggered dynamic access changes in near real-time</li>
<li>Leavers were disabled within minutes of HR action</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only did we eliminate security gaps—we gave back hours of productivity to our teams and passed our first true access audit with zero major findings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lesson learned: manual JML processes don’t scale. If you’re still relying on spreadsheets or ticketing alone, <strong>start automating now.</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="-cited-study">📚 Cited Study</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a 2023 <strong>Ponemon Institute</strong> report, organizations that automated identity lifecycle processes reduced insider threat-related incidents by <strong>45%</strong> and saw a 28% drop in audit violations tied to excessive access.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="-final-thoughts">🧭 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Lifecycle management isn’t flashy, but it’s foundational. It’s where automation, governance, and Zero Trust meet. When done well, JML enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tighter security</li>
<li>Better compliance</li>
<li>Happier employees and IT teams</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to start small—integrate HR, automate basic onboarding/offboarding, and grow into adaptive access and recertification.</p>

<p>IAM isn’t just about protecting access—it’s about controlling it from <strong>beginning to end.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1 id="iam-101-authentication-explained--the-front-door-to-your-digital-world">IAM 101: Authentication Explained – The Front Door to Your Digital World</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying that users are who they say they are. It’s the gatekeeper to every digital system, and when done poorly, it becomes the #1 way attackers break in. From passwords to biometrics to FIDO2, authentication has evolved into a key pillar of Zero Trust security. In this post, we’ll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How authentication works</li>
<li>Different types (and what’s still worth using)</li>
<li>Best practices for IT teams</li>
<li>How AI, phishing, and automation are shifting the landscape</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-background">🔍 Background</h2>
<p>After 15 years working in Identity and Access Management, I can confidently say: <strong>authentication is where security begins—or where it breaks down</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s the “front door” to every SaaS tool, server, admin panel, and application your users interact with. And just like your house, if you leave the front door wide open (or protected by a flimsy lock), don’t be surprised if someone walks right in.</p>
<p>According to Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, <strong>over 80% of hacking-related breaches involved stolen or weak credentials.</strong> The problem isn’t new, but the stakes are getting higher as threats grow more targeted—and tools more automated.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about what authentication is, how it’s changing, and what IT pros like you can do to get it right.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-what-is-authentication">🧠 What Is Authentication?</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of proving that you are who you claim to be before accessing a digital system. It precedes <strong>authorization</strong> (what you can do once inside) and is a non-negotiable first step in any secure architecture.</p>
<h3 id="the-classic-formula">The Classic Formula:</h3>
<p>Authentication typically relies on one or more of the following factors:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Factor Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Examples</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Something you know</strong></td>
          <td>A shared secret</td>
          <td>Passwords, PINs</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Something you have</strong></td>
          <td>A physical or digital token</td>
          <td>Smart card, phone, hardware key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Something you are</strong></td>
          <td>A biometric identifier</td>
          <td>Fingerprint, face scan, voice</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Somewhere you are</strong></td>
          <td>Contextual factor (location)</td>
          <td>GPS-based access limits</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Something you do</strong></td>
          <td>Behavioral analysis</td>
          <td>Typing cadence, device use</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The strength of your authentication setup depends on the mix of these factors. Using just one? That’s <strong>single-factor authentication</strong>. Using two or more? Welcome to <strong>MFA</strong>—a must-have in 2025.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-why-its-more-than-just-passwords">🔐 Why It’s More Than Just Passwords</h2>
<p>Passwords are the oldest form of digital authentication—and still the most common. But let’s be honest: <strong>they’re also the weakest</strong>.</p>
<p>People reuse passwords across systems, choose easily guessable strings (like “Welcome1!”), or store them in insecure ways. Even IT pros are guilty of “temporary” shared passwords that never get rotated.</p>
<p>Enter modern authentication practices:</p>
<h3 id="-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
<p>Combines two or more types of authentication factors. A password + a mobile push notification is now the baseline for secure access.</p>
<h3 id="-passwordless-authentication">🔏 Passwordless Authentication</h3>
<p>With FIDO2/WebAuthn, users authenticate using secure public/private key pairs without typing anything. Think Windows Hello or YubiKeys.</p>
<h3 id="-adaptive-authentication">🧠 Adaptive Authentication</h3>
<p>AI or rule-based systems that consider context (IP, time of day, geolocation, risk signals) to allow or challenge logins dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> use the strongest method available <em>without destroying user experience</em>. Security is only effective if people don’t try to bypass it.</p>

<h2 id="-implementation-what-it-teams-need-to-consider">⚙️ Implementation: What IT Teams Need to Consider</h2>
<p>Rolling out authentication isn’t just picking a method—it’s configuring it well, integrating it broadly, and monitoring it continuously.</p>
<p>Here’s what I advise based on real-world deployments:</p>
<h3 id="1-start-with-critical-apps">1. <strong>Start with Critical Apps</strong></h3>
<p>Enforce MFA on email, HR, and finance tools first. These are your crown jewels.</p>
<h3 id="2-support-passwordless-where-possible">2. <strong>Support Passwordless Where Possible</strong></h3>
<p>Modern IdPs like Okta, Entra, and Ping now support WebAuthn. Start small—like enabling it for privileged users—and scale from there.</p>
<h3 id="3-mitigate-mfa-fatigue">3. <strong>Mitigate MFA Fatigue</strong></h3>
<p>Use context-aware policies to reduce unnecessary prompts. Prompt only when risk changes (e.g., new location or device).</p>
<h3 id="4-educate-end-users">4. <strong>Educate End Users</strong></h3>
<p>Explain <em>why</em> they’re being prompted. Security is a partnership, not a punishment.</p>
<h3 id="5-log-everything">5. <strong>Log Everything</strong></h3>
<p>Authentication events are gold during incident response. Make sure you’re capturing success/failure logs, device metadata, and location data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ai-and-the-future-of-authentication">📈 AI and the Future of Authentication</h2>
<p>The authentication landscape is evolving fast—and AI is both a threat and an opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="-threat-smarter-phishing">🚨 Threat: Smarter Phishing</h3>
<p>AI can now generate incredibly convincing login pages and spearphishing messages. Credentials are being harvested faster than ever.</p>
<h3 id="-opportunity-smarter-defense">🛡️ Opportunity: Smarter Defense</h3>
<p>Behavioral biometrics and AI-driven anomaly detection are helping identity platforms detect and stop threats in real time—<em>before</em> passwords are compromised.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="IAM Identity Overview" loading="lazy" src="/images/post_eight.png"></p>
<h1 id="iam-101-what-is-identity-and-access-management-iam">IAM 101: What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?</h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the framework that ensures secure, efficient control over who (users, devices, or systems) can access what resources within an organization. For IT professionals, IAM is foundational to cybersecurity, compliance, and operational scalability. Core components include authentication, authorization, user lifecycle management, and auditing. Challenges like shadow IT and hybrid environments persist, but solutions like Zero Trust and AI-driven automation are rising. Bonus: Use <strong>GPT prompts for SEO</strong> to streamline policy documentation and access reviews.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="background-the-rise-of-identity-centric-security">Background: The Rise of Identity-Centric Security</h2>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) emerged as a response to the growing complexity of digital ecosystems. In the 1990s, basic username/password systems sufficed. But with cloud adoption, remote work, and APIs, organizations needed a way to manage identities <em>and</em> enforce least privilege at scale.</p>
<p>IAM answers two critical questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who/What is requesting access?</strong> (Authentication)</li>
<li><strong>What are they allowed to do?</strong> (Authorization)</li>
</ol>
<p>For IT teams, IAM isn’t just about security—it’s about enabling productivity. A well-designed IAM system reduces friction (e.g., via Single Sign-On) while minimizing risks like lateral movement in breaches. According to the <strong>Verizon 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report</strong>, <strong>74% of all breaches involve human error or stolen credentials</strong>, underscoring IAM’s role as a first line of defense.</p>

<h3 id="1-mitigate-insider-threats">1. <strong>Mitigate Insider Threats</strong></h3>
<p>Overprivileged accounts (e.g., ex-employees with lingering access) are a top attack vector. IAM automates deprovisioning and enforces least privilege.</p>
<h3 id="2-simplify-compliance">2. <strong>Simplify Compliance</strong></h3>
<p>Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX require auditable access controls. IAM centralizes logging and policy enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="3-support-hybrid-environments">3. <strong>Support Hybrid Environments</strong></h3>
<p>With resources split between on-prem, cloud, and third-party SaaS (e.g., AWS, Salesforce), IAM provides unified governance.</p>
<h3 id="4-enable-devops--cicd-pipelines">4. <strong>Enable DevOps &amp; CI/CD Pipelines</strong></h3>
<p>Machine identities (API keys, service accounts) now outnumber human users. IAM secures secrets and automates credential rotation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="core-components-of-iam">Core Components of IAM</h2>
<h3 id="1-authentication">1. <strong>Authentication</strong></h3>
<p>Verifies identity through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>: Combines passwords with tokens, biometrics, or device trust.</li>
<li><strong>Federated Identity</strong>: Protocols like SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect enable cross-domain SSO.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-authorization">2. <strong>Authorization</strong></h3>
<p>Defines permissions using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: Assigns access based on job roles (e.g., &ldquo;Network Admin&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: Grants access dynamically using context (time, location, risk score).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-user-lifecycle-management">3. <strong>User Lifecycle Management</strong></h3>
<p>Automates provisioning/deprovisioning across systems via SCIM or LDAP.</p>
<h3 id="4-auditing--reporting">4. <strong>Auditing &amp; Reporting</strong></h3>
