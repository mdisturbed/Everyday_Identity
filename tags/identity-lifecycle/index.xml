<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) governs the entire digital identity journey‚Äîfrom onboarding new employees to adjusting access when they change roles, to securely deactivating accounts when they leave. This &ldquo;Joiners, Movers, and Leavers&rdquo; process is critical to both security and operational efficiency. When mismanaged, it leads to overprovisioned users, dormant accounts, compliance failures, and insider threats. This article breaks down the core lifecycle stages, shows how automation can fix the chaos, and offers practical strategies drawn from real enterprise deployments.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-background">üîç Background</h2>
<p>After 15 years in IAM, I&rsquo;ve learned this: the <strong>lifecycle is where most identity programs succeed‚Äîor completely fall apart</strong>.</p>
<p>You can have MFA, PAM, and Zero Trust. But if former employees still have access, or if contractors sit dormant in your HR system, your ‚Äúsecure perimeter‚Äù is full of holes.</p>
<p>The lifecycle process‚Äîcommonly called <strong>JML (Joiners, Movers, Leavers)</strong>‚Äîis one of the most overlooked pillars in Identity and Access Management. It should be simple. In practice? It‚Äôs often a tangled web of manual tickets, disconnected systems, and tribal knowledge.</p>
<p>This post will help you fix that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-the-three-stages-of-lifecycle-management">üë• The Three Stages of Lifecycle Management</h2>
<h3 id="-1-joiners--onboarding-users-securely">üîπ 1. <strong>Joiners ‚Äì Onboarding Users Securely</strong></h3>
<p>Joiners are new hires, contractors, interns, or vendors who need accounts and access. This is your first chance to make a secure <em>and</em> smooth first impression.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger provisioning from your source of truth (HRIS like Workday, SAP, or BambooHR)</li>
<li>Automatically assign access based on role, department, location</li>
<li>Require MFA enrollment at first login</li>
<li>Limit access to least privilege from day one</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>‚úÖ Example: A new marketing associate is hired. Their role triggers automatic creation of email, Slack, Adobe, and SharePoint access. MFA and training are enforced before access is granted.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-2-movers--managing-internal-changes">üîπ 2. <strong>Movers ‚Äì Managing Internal Changes</strong></h3>
<p>Movers are people who shift roles, departments, locations, or teams. Without a process, movers accumulate access‚Äîleading to &ldquo;permission bloat&rdquo; and audit nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use real-time attribute updates (title, department, manager) from HR</li>
<li>Automatically adjust group memberships, entitlements, and app access</li>
<li>Remove no-longer-needed access as part of each move</li>
<li>Trigger a re-certification or approval flow for sensitive access</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>‚úÖ Example: A finance analyst moves to sales ops. Finance access is revoked, CRM access is granted, and access to reporting tools is adjusted automatically.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="-3-leavers--offboarding-without-loose-ends">üîπ 3. <strong>Leavers ‚Äì Offboarding Without Loose Ends</strong></h3>
<p>Leavers include employees who resign, are terminated, or complete contracts. This is where poor lifecycle processes turn into real security risks.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Termination in HR triggers immediate deprovisioning</li>
<li>Disable SSO and privileged accounts within minutes</li>
<li>Archive email and files where applicable</li>
<li>Reclaim licenses, devices, and security tokens</li>
<li>Notify managers and stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>‚úÖ Example: A contractor finishes their engagement. Their end date in HR disables all accounts within 15 minutes, notifies IT, and removes their access from Zoom, Jira, and AWS.</p></blockquote>

<p>I once consulted for a healthcare org where <strong>access removal took 3‚Äì5 days</strong> due to manual ServiceNow tickets. During that lag, former employees still had access to PHI. We implemented HR-triggered provisioning with SailPoint + Okta, reducing offboarding time to under 15 minutes‚Äîand passed their next HIPAA audit cleanly.</p>
<p>Another client used a shared spreadsheet for managing contractor access. You can guess what happened: hundreds of active accounts for people who hadn‚Äôt worked there in years.</p>
<p>Lifecycle failures aren‚Äôt hypothetical. They‚Äôre happening daily‚Äîand they‚Äôre avoidable.</p>

<h2 id="-real-world-lessons-from-the-field">üèõÔ∏è Real-World Lessons from the Field</h2>
<p>During my time at a previous role, we kicked off our IAM journey the hard way‚Äî<strong>with Excel spreadsheets</strong>. Every new hire, role change, or termination required someone in IT or HR to manually update a shared document. It wasn‚Äôt just tedious‚Äîit was <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>Onboarding could take <strong>hours or even days</strong>, depending on when someone reviewed the sheet and how fast the manual tickets were processed. Sometimes users would start on day one without email or key app access. Others left the company, but their access lingered‚Äîsometimes for weeks‚Äîbecause no one flagged them for removal.</p>
<p>We had no centralized system, no automation, and no visibility. It was a perfect storm for audit failures, excessive access, and frustrated managers.</p>
<p>That experience was a turning point. We implemented a modern IAM platform integrated with Workday and Okta. Once we moved from Excel to policy-based automation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joiners had accounts ready before day one</li>
<li>Movers triggered dynamic access changes in near real-time</li>
<li>Leavers were disabled within minutes of HR action</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only did we eliminate security gaps‚Äîwe gave back hours of productivity to our teams and passed our first true access audit with zero major findings.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: manual JML processes don‚Äôt scale. If you‚Äôre still relying on spreadsheets or ticketing alone, <strong>start automating now.</strong></p></blockquote>
